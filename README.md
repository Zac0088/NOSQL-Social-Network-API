# NOSQL-Social-Network-API

## Description

AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Acceptance criteria

GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list

### Models

**User**:

* `username`
  * String
  * Unique
  * Required
  * Trimmed

* `email`
  * String
  * Required
  * Unique
  * Must match a valid email address (look into Mongoose's matching validation)

* `thoughts`
  * Array of `_id` values referencing the `Thought` model

* `friends`
  * Array of `_id` values referencing the `User` model (self-reference)

**Schema Settings**:

Create a virtual called `friendCount` that retrieves the length of the user's `friends` array field on query.

---

**Thought**:

* `thoughtText`
  * String
  * Required
  * Must be between 1 and 280 characters

* `createdAt`
  * Date
  * Set default value to the current timestamp
  * Use a getter method to format the timestamp on query

* `username` (The user that created this thought)
  * String
  * Required

* `reactions` (These are like replies)
  * Array of nested documents created with the `reactionSchema`

**Schema Settings**:

Create a virtual called `reactionCount` that retrieves the length of the thought's `reactions` array field on query.

---

**Reaction** (SCHEMA ONLY)

* `reactionId`
  * Use Mongoose's ObjectId data type
  * Default value is set to a new ObjectId

* `reactionBody`
  * String
  * Required
  * 280 character maximum

* `username`
  * String
  * Required

* `createdAt`
  * Date
  * Set default value to the current timestamp
  * Use a getter method to format the timestamp on query

**Schema Settings**:

This will not be a model, but rather will be used as the `reaction` field's subdocument schema in the `Thought` model.

### API Routes

**`/api/users`**

* `GET` all users

* `GET` a single user by its `_id` and populated thought and friend data

* `POST` a new user:

  "email": "lernantino@gmail.com"
}
```

* `PUT` to update a user by its `_id`

* `DELETE` to remove user by its `_id`

**BONUS**: Remove a user's associated thoughts when deleted.

---

**`/api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId`**

* `POST` to add a new friend to a user's friend list

* `DELETE` to remove a friend from a user's friend list
